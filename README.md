## Getting Started
- **Download grid.js from the respitory.**

  [Download raw file](https://github.com/SelfTaught-HamzaCodes/grid.p5/blob/main/grid.js)
  
- Add it to the same folder as your canvas.
  
  ```
  project-folder/
  â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
  â”œâ”€â”€ grid.js
  â”œâ”€â”€ p5.min.js
  â””â”€â”€ sketch.js
  ```
- Add **grid.js** as a script to **index.html**.
  
  ```
  <script src="grid.js"></script>
  ```

- Call the function just before you close your draw function in sketch.js.

  This positions the grid above all other shapes, simplifying the creation of intricate designs with precision.
