# Grid in p5.js
A JavaScript script for p5.js that creates a customizable grid on the canvas. Use this script to easily add grid lines and labels to your p5.js sketches, aiding in precise positioning and alignment of elements.
<br></br>
## Getting Started
- Download **grid.js** from the respitory.
- Add it to the same folder as your canvas.
  
  ```
  project-folder/
  â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
  â”œâ”€â”€ grid.js
  â”œâ”€â”€ p5.min.js
  â””â”€â”€ sketch.js
  ```
- Add **grid.js** as a script to **index.html**.
  
  ```
  <script src="grid.js"></script>
  ```

- Simply call `drawGrid()` in **sketch.js** after `createCanvas()`.
  ```
  function setup()
  {
	//create a canvas for the robot
	createCanvas(500, 500);
    //draw grid with a spacing of 50. 
	drawGrid(40);
  }	
  ```
